Build instructions:

cmake and wxWidgets installations are required.
The build is supported on Windows; with some more time & effort it could also be done on Linux and Macs.

On Windows:

1. Edit wxwidgets path in CMakeLists.txt for your environment.
2. Under game_of_life directory:
   a. mkdir build\win32 directory
   b. cd build\win32
2. Generate Visual Studio solution file; as an example for VS Express 2013:

   cmake ..\.. -G "Visual Studio 12"

3. In main.cpp, a default input file is currently hardcoded, but you can also pass a program argument to specify another file.
